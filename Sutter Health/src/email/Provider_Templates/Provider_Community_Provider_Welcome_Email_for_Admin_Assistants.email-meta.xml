The accuracy and integrity of provider business information is a priority at Sutter Health. Accurate data ensures that patientsâ€™ protected health information (PHI), as well as other important business related documents, are delivered to a provider&apos;s preferred location. Sutter Health providers are asked to validate their contact information every 6 months.



If a patient of provider you represent may ever be seen at a Sutter Health affiliate for future care or outpatient services (e.g. radiology &amp; lab tests), and/or Sutter patients may be referred to to this provider for follow-up care, it is important that you review--and if necessary update--the provider&apos;s contact information.




To validate the provider&apos;s contact information, visit the Sutter Provider Hub, a self-service application that allows you to easily and securely manage the provider&apos;s Sutter Health information. Clicking the link will take you to a page where you can set your password, then log in with the Username supplied below.
