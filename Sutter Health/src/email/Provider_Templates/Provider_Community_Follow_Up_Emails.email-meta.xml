    <subject>Reminder: ACTION REQUESTED - Validate Your Contact Information Through Sutter Provider Hub!</subject>
    <textOnly>This is a reminder to validate your primary contact information through Sutter Provider Hub, a self-service program that allows you to manage your Sutter Health contact information.


If a patient of yours may ever be seen at a Sutter Health affiliate for future care or outpatient services (e.g. radiology &amp; lab tests), and/or Sutter patients may be referred to you for follow-up care, it is important that you review--and if necessary update--your contact information.


Accurate contact information for clinical providers ensures consistent support for you, as well as safe, secure delivery of our shared patients’ Protected Health Information (PHI).



Please follow the instructions below to access Sutter Provider Hub for validation of your primary contact information.
