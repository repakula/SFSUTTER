    <subject>ACTION REQUESTED: Validate Your Contact Information Through Sutter Provider Hub</subject>
    <textOnly>The accuracy and integrity of your business information is a priority at Sutter Health. Accurate data ensures that your patientsâ€™ protected health information (PHI), as well as other important business related documents, are delivered to your preferred location. In order to maintain the accuracy of your data, you will be asked to validate your contact information every 6 months.

If a patient of yours may ever be seen at a Sutter Health affiliate for future care or outpatient services (e.g. radiology &amp; lab tests), and/or Sutter patients may be referred to you for follow-up care, it is important that you review--and if necessary update--your contact information through the Sutter Provider Hub. This self-service portal allows you to easily and securely manage your Sutter Health information.

NEW: You can now use your Sutter username and password as well as single sign-on (when inside the Sutter network) to access the Sutter Provider Hub.


Login instructions:

Delegate information:

Certain providers may authorize a delegate (administrative assistant, office manager, etc.) to validate contact information on their behalf. If you see a named individual below, that person has been identified as a potential delegate.  Within the next several days, you will receive another email through which you can provide formal access approval for this individual to validate your data in the future.
