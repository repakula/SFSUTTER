To: &lt;Sutter Health Managers&gt;

From: Guy W. Turner, Chief Information Security Officer


Subject: Single Sign-On Access to MySutter Connection



The following message will be sent to all employees later this afternoon.


Our Information Services team recognizes the challenge of remembering multiple usernames and passwords to access the many applications you may need to perform your job. With that in mind, we worked hard to find solutions to reduce the number of different application logins.


As a result of these efforts, beginning April 23, employees will use their Sutter Health sign-on when accessing MySutter Connection from outside the Sutter Health network. Most users already have automated access to MySutter Connection when directly connected to our network.


If you have questions, please contact John Abel (AbelJ@sutterhealth.org). An FAQ is available on the DSO portal.
